**AGENTIQ -AUTONOMOUS PROJECT BUILDING AGENT**

AGENTIQ is a multi-agent system powered by Gemini that converts a natural-language prompt into a fully structured, ready-to-run software project.
This project was built for the Kaggle × Google 5-Day AI Agents Intensive (Capstone Project).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Setting up a new software project is repetitive and time-consuming.
Beginners, students, and developers often spend hours creating boilerplate:
-folder structures

-configuration files

-Python/Node setups

-HTML/CSS/JS scaffolding

-basic backend routes

-virtual environments

This slows down learning, experimentation, and rapid prototyping.
I wanted to remove this friction and build a system that lets you focus on your idea, not setup.

**SOLUTION:**

AGENTIQ is a three-agent architecture:

**Planner Agent**

Breaks the user request into actionable steps.

**Builder Agent**

Uses Gemini  to generate a complete project 

**Reviewer Agent**

Performs a lightweight validation to ensure files are consistent.
